Create the interfaces Flight and Swim.

The Flight interface has 1 method:

String fly();

The Swim interface has also 1 method:

String swim();

Create following 5 classes:

Fish implementing Swim — the swim method should return “Swims under water”

Plane implementing Flight — the fly method should return “Flies with engine”

Duck implementing Swim and Flight — the swim method should return “Kinda floats”

                                                           — the fly method returns “Flies with wings”

Pegasus implementing Flight — the fly method should return “Flies with wings”

Submarine implementing Swim — the swim method should return “Swims under water”

Create a Main class which will test your code.

-   Create an object for each of these 5 classes.

- The class is supposed to have 2 Lists: 
	An ArrayList containing things that can fly 
	A LinkedList of things that can swim

- Loop through both lists and print the output of fly and swim methods of all the objects in these 
lists.

NOTE: Implementing multiple interfaces is done by separating the Interface names that we 
want to implement with a comma. A implements B, C ...

Create the abstract class Shape.

The Shape has 1 attribute: colour (String)

Every shape can return it’s area and circumference, both returning double.

Create 3 classes:

Circle, Square and Rectangle. All of these are colourful shapes.

1. Circle:

Has 1 attribute:

radius (double)

Area = radius2 x PI 
Circumference = 2 x radius x PI 
2. Square 
Has 1 attribute: 
side (double) 
Area = side x side 
Circumference = 4 x side 
3. Rectangle 
Has 2 Attributes: 
a (double) 
b (double) 
Area = a x b 
Circumference = 2 x a + 2 x b

It should be possible to call toString() for either Square, Circle or Rectangle and the output should 
always be:

“colour: {colour}, area: {the area}, circumference: {the circumference}”

Create a Main class to test your code.

Create an object of each shape, and put them into a Shape List.

Iterate through the list, and print the output of toString() for each of them.

NOTES:  
1. Abstract classes can have constructors just like normal classes. 
2. For calculating PI use Math.PI 
3. Regarding the toString() part: BE SMART, THINK
